# Go Conventions

## Naming and Cases

- Naming conventions in Go is not a matter of `style`, it is a matter of `syntax`.
- Public functions will have `PascalCase` naming convention
- Private functions will have `camelCase` naming convention
- Variables and Constats will have `camelCase` naming convention
- `_` should not be used for naming variables, it is used by go compiler to omit unused values
